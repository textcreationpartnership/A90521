            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O did we but believe this, were our hearts indeed but thorowly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this, and did we but walk daily in the ſenſe, and conſideration of this, that the Scripture cannot be broken, how much more ſhould we profit by
<pb facs="tcp:121189:8"/> the Scripture than we do? how would threatnings more awe us, promiſes, and prophecies more chear us? &amp; in a word all Scripture more advantage us?</p>

And this account I thought good to give, of what I have done; and if this will not ſatisfie, as I ſuppoſe, ſcarce any thing will ſome in this carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age, I ſhall ſay no more, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

               <p>Thus it is not that we account our ſelves bleſſed, or others account, or call us ſo, that indeed ſpeaks us ſo, but it is, when the Scripture calls, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us ſo, when we are among<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the number of the Scripture-bleſſed-ones, for that cannot be broken, that cannot err, or miſtake, ſo that if we be but indeed and in truth, ſuch as that doth pronounce bleſſed, we are indeed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for we are ſure, that the judgement of the Scripture is according to truth, and therefore as not <hi>he that commends himſelf is approved,</hi> ſo not he that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf or others bleſs is bleſſed, but he whom the Scripture bleſſes.</p>

               <p>2. From hence we are informed, and given to ſee, whence it is that there is yet a Miniſtery in the world, ſurely it is from hence, becauſe there are in the Scripture ſo many gracious promiſes made, as concerning the continuing and upholding the ſame, and the Scripture cannot be broken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is not at this day the Miniſtery broken and utterly extinct, becauſe the Scripture cannot be broken. Truly it is marvellous, and may ſeem ſtrange, that there ſhould be yet a Miniſtery in the World, conſidering, Firſt, the many Enemies on every hand that it ſtill hath, both open, and ſecret, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and politick; Atheiſts, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Apoſtates, and Schiſmaticks, and Sectaries of all ſorts, as Quakers, Ranters Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, and what not? however they may in ſome things diſagree among themſelves, yet herein have and do all agree for to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:121189:57"/> the Miniſtery. And ſecondly, conſidering how many wayes and meanes have been, and ſtill are attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ruine it, what ſtones have been left unturned; what deſignes unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed, to overthrow it? many of which have notably of late been held forth
<note n="v" place="margin">Jus Divinum Miniſterij Evangelici Preface.</note> as 1. By railing upon, and reviling the perſons of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and raiſing all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Crying down the preſent Miniſtery as Antichriſtian,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, By taking avvay their maintainance, or at leaſt attempting it. Fourthly, By ſetting up the baſeſt and meaneſt of the People, and ſuch as have no Arts nor Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Tongues to be Preachers, that thereby they might make the World believe, that the Miniſterial Office is of all other, the loweſt and eaſieſt. Fifthly, By denying the very Office it ſelf; theſe with divers others of the like nature, have been, and ſtill are the vvayes and meanes vvhereby many ſeek to ruin the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>And if to all theſe we add, the Worlds woful undervaluing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of the Miniſtery, treading that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:121189:58"/> under their feet, vvhich they ſhould wear as <hi>a Crown upon their Head,</hi> I<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 1.</note> mean the Miniſters and their Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrine, O how much more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full will it appear, that there is yet a Miniſtery in the World? but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot be broken, made void, and therefore though it be wonderful, yet it is ſo. Thus that there is a Miniſtery yet in the World, it is not that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, together with his inſtruments of all ſorts, have been wanting to overthrow it; It is not that the ungrateful World hath not demerited the removal of it; but becauſe Gods Word cannot be made void, I mean as to a Miniſtery ſomewhere, though not it may be here or there, in this or that place, but in ſome place; Thus that the Miniſtery of the Word ſhall continue to the end of the World, is clearly held forth, <hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12, 13. And he gave ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts; and ſome Paſtors, and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of the Body of Chriſt: till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121189:58"/> perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt: Till we all come,</hi> that is here to be marked and obſerved, that the Miniſtery is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end, the uſe of it being to the end while we are in the World-Look as while a houſe is not fully built, the Workmen may not be diſmiſſed; So until the Houſe of God have every Believer, every ſtone of it laid, the Builders of it muſt be continued; hence this Miniſtery of the Paſtor and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is called an induring Miniſtery, a Miniſtery that remains, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 11. For if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Lord hath alwayes had Paſtors and Teachers in his Church, though they have not alwayes been ſo apparent, and ſo will have to the end of the World, maugre all the malice of Satan and his inſtruments, thus it is ſaid, <hi>Revel. 12. 6. That the Woman,</hi> i. e. the Church, <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe had a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes.</hi> The Church here, is in an obſcure, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:121189:59"/> and ſolitary condition, <hi>in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi> and yet ſhe has
<hi>a place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of God that they ſhould feed her,</hi> they, who? this ſeemes to refer to the 2. Witneſſes, <hi>Chapter</hi> 11. 3. Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters they ſhould feed her there, for it falls out in the ſame time, as appears by the number of dayes, <hi>Chapter</hi> 11.
3. An Alluſion to the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs. Gods faithful Miniſters are thoſe that feed the Church, <hi>Jer. 3. 15. John 21. 15. Acts</hi> 20. 28. And theſe here are ſent forth by God for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to feed, maintain, and uphold the Church of God, Now all the while ſhe is in the Wilderneſs, in her obſcure, retired, afflicted, and ſolitary ſtate and condition; So that the Church hath ſtill in her obſcureſt ſtate, had her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers that feed her, and ſo ſhall have to the end of the World.</p>

<hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 38, 39. For if this Counſel, or this work be of Man (ſpeaking of the work which the Apoſtles did act and carry on) <hi>i. e.</hi> ordained of Men, and taken up meerly by humane authority, it will come to nought, it will be broken, the

                  </gap>, but if it be of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> ordained &amp; appointed by him, undertaken, and caried on by his authority &amp; command, ye cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow it, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thus we ſee whence it is, that there is yet a Church and Miniſtery in the World, that they are not utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown and broken, it is, becauſe theſe and the like Scriptures cannot be broken; and how comfortable is this to think, that let Hell break looſe, and the World never ſo much rage, yet God will ſtill have a Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in the World, both thoſe that ſhall teach, and others that ſhall be taught, even to end of the World, for the word affirming it, it cannot be made void.</p>

                  </gap>oken; O that we could in truth ſay, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 14. That we believe all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets, ther's great cauſe we ſhould do ſo, being that which cannot be broken; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour ſharply reproves thoſe
2. Diſciples, for their ſlowneſs of heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken,
<hi>Luke 24. 25. O Fooles, and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoke;</hi> Fooles, becauſe ſlow of heart to believe, it being that which muſt be, and cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>3. And Thirdly, Let us not onely believe this, but walk daily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually under a ſenſe and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, with this firmly fixt upon our Spirits, and ſtill in our minds, that the Scripture cannot be broken; and ſurely there is no one thing as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture that would or could be of greater uſe, or more ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:121189:67"/> to us than this, to believe and daily to live in the ſenſe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of this truth of the Scriptures impoſſibility of being broken; O what a ſingular, and ſovereign way and meanes would this be to bring us much to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by all Scripture, by Prophecies, by Promiſes, by Threatnings, yea, by what ever it ſaith or affirmes.</p>
               <p>As the Scripture ſaies, and affirmes, yea, as good as ſweares, that <hi>except a Man be born again, born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3. 3,
5. And now this being Scripture, and ſo that which cannot be broken, did we but believe this, and were our hearts but throughly perſwaded of this, and did we but daily walk in the ſenſe and apprehenſion of this, could we neglect this great work of Regeneration of being born again, as we do? And ſo I might inſtance as concerning Knowledge, <hi>Iſay</hi> 27. 11. Concerning Faith,
<hi>Iohn 8. 24. 3. 36. Marke</hi> 16. 16. Concerning Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3, 5. Concerning ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>Hebrewes. 12, 14. Iohn</hi> 13. 8. O did people but believe, that in what the Scripture ſaies of the neceſſity of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:121189:68"/> theſe it could not be broken, could they ſlight and neglect them as they do?</p>
               <p>So when the Scripture affirmes, that <hi>every idle word that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of Iudgement,</hi> Matthew 12. 36. O did Men but believe this, and walk conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the ſenſe and apprehenſion of this, that in this the Scripture cannot be broken; Would they not be more circumſpect in their words? Would they be vain and frothy in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, as many times they are? ſo when the Scripture affirmes, that <hi>we must all appear before the Iudgement Seat of Chriſt, that every one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things done in his body accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. Would they not have a greater Care what they did?</p>
               <p>So the Scripture ſayes, <hi>ſtraight is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14. 1 Peter 4.

                  <hi>the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it, and the righteous ſcarcely are ſaved,</hi> and now the belief and perſwaſion of this in the Heart, and ſenſe of it upon the Spirit, would it not make people
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:121189:68"/> more ſtudious and more induſtrious to be ſaved? So it ſaies, that
<hi>a rich</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 23</note> 
                  <hi>Man ſhall hardly enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> and were there a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and ſenſe of this upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that herein the Scriptures cannot be broken, would Men be ſo ſtudious and deſirous to be rich as they are? or having riches, would they be leſs ſolicitous of entring into the Kingdom of Heaven than others, who can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier enter in than other men?</p>
               <p>And ſo I might very much inlarge my ſelf herein, to ſhew and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate unto you, of what ſingular uſe and advantage it would be unto us, did we believe, and withall walk in the ſenſe &amp; apprehenſion of this truth, that the Scriptures ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be broken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how would Threatnings more ſtartle &amp; terrifie the wicked? and how would Promiſes more comfort and cheer the godly? <hi>The God of hope,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>fill you</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ro. 15. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>with all joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and peace in believing;</hi> I, this is the way indeed, for Chriſtians to have their ſouls filled with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> joy and peace, as concerning the promiſes, by believing them, and by walking in the ſenſe and apprehenſion of this, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:121189:69"/> they are ſuch as cannot be broken; this was the way indeed to ſuck and draw out the ſweetneſs of them. But of this I ſhall ſpeak more afterward in the uſe of Conſolation.</p>
               <p>4. Cannot the Scripture be broken, can it not err or be deceived, but is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing ſo as the Scripture ſaies and affirms? Let this prevail with us then, to ſeal and aſſent to what ever it ſaies, though it ſeemes never ſo ſtrange, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, or improbable to carnal ſenſe and reaſon, or croſs and contrary to our own corrupt judgements, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, for the Scripture cannot be broken, as that in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. and the 31. <hi>verſe.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>if they hear not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one riſe from the dead.</hi> No, the world thinks otherwiſe, O did but a Man riſe from the dead, did but a wicked man come from Hell, and tell others what he there ſuffers, and what they were like to ſuffer, if they did not mend their manners, O this would prevail with them, by this they would be perſwaded; no, they would not, for the Scripture ſayes, and that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:121189:69"/> cannot be broken, <hi>if they hear not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead,</hi> ſuch as are not perſwaded by the Word preached, ſuch would not be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead. So <hi>Iſay</hi>
27. 11. There it is ſaid, <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi> Now the World thinks otherwiſe, O ſay they, he that made us, will ſave us, but let this prevail with us, to ſeal to this truth, becauſe it is Scripture, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken. So <hi>Matthew</hi>
19. 23. Then ſaid <hi>Jeſus</hi> unto his Diſciples, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that a rich Man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And again, <hi>I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a camel to go through,</hi> &amp;c. So 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26, 27. For ye ſee your calling, Brethren how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Matthew 16. 25.

                     </gap> 10. 29, 30. Verily I ſay unto
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:121189:70"/> you, there is no Man that hath left houſe, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my ſake, and the Goſpels, but he ſhall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houſes, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Mothers, and Children, and Lands, with Perſecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</hi> Now theſe, and many the like, are Paradoxes to the World, but what ever they be to the World, let this prevail with us, for to ſeal to them, they being Scripture, and the Scripture being that which cannot be broken. And let us ſeal to theſe and the like, not not onely Verbally, but really, not onely in point of Judgement and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of practice; as when it is ſaid, <hi>Straight is the gate, &amp; narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that finde it,</hi> Matthew 7. 14.
<hi>And the righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved,</hi> 1 Peter 4. 18. <hi>i. e.</hi> not without much difficulty, and ado, not without great labour, the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thus when it is ſaid, <hi>What is a Man profited if he ſhall gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> i. e. a Man is no whit at all profited; let us really ſeal to the truth hereof, by more minding our ſouls, and leſs regarding the profits of the World, ſo that
<hi>we muſt appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. by labouring that we <hi>may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him,</hi> and found in peace. To that, <hi>that Satan goes up and down like a roaring Lion,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Peter 5. 8. by being as the Apoſtle exhorts, the more ſober and vigilant.</p>
               <p>And ſo I might inſtance as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Scripture ſaies of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,

               <p>As to inſtance in ſome particulars, the Scripture ſaith and affirms of God, that he is good, it ſaith and affirms ſo often, <hi>Nahum 1. 7. The Lord is good,</hi> Pſa. 106. 1.

               <p>O let us never reſt, as concerning what the Scripture ſaith, and affirms of things, till we be able to ſay, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid in another caſe to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 10. 6, 7. <hi>and ſhe ſaid to the King, it was a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that I heard, and behold the half was not told me;</hi> ſo the reports I heard out of the Scripture were true reports, what out of the Scripture was reported, and made forth unto me, of the goodneſs of God, and the loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt, of the beauty of holineſs, of the Amiableneſs of Gods Ordinances, of the pleaſantneſs of Chriſts wayes, of the vanity of the world, of the vileneſs of ſin, O they were all true reports; and behold the half was not told me.</p>

I have heard of thee, by the hearing of the ear, but now
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:121189:74"/> mine eye ſeeth thee,</hi> ſo I have heard of thee, and heard of Chriſt, and heard of other things, by the hearing of the ear, Miniſters have made ſuch and ſuch reports of them, &amp; now I ſee them to be ſo indeed, as the Miniſter ſaid of them, I can from my own experience ſay now as he ſaid, and as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, now I believe his reports; and truly we ſhall never believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the word, till the Arm of the Lord be ſo revealed, as that we come indeed, not only to hear of them, but to ſee them, <hi>Iſa. 53.
1. Who hath belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our report?</hi> &amp;c. And therefore, <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are their eyes, who ſee,</hi> as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith in another caſe, who ſo ſee, and apprehend things to be as the Scripture ſaith, and affirms of them, for ſo indeed they are, and muſt be, the Scripture being that which cannot be broken, which cannot err, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
               <p>6. Again, cannot the Scripture be broken? then from hence ſhould we be exhorted, and provoked to be much in bleſſing, and praiſing of God. Firſt, That God ſhould find out a way to ſave
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:121189:75"/> man, and yet what he had threatned for mans ſinning, be ſalved, and not be broken, &amp;c.—Secondly, that thoſe things, which are of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and concernment, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſo great cauſe and ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and on which our whole happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depends, are according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which cannot be broken. And thirdly, that the Lord hath brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us into ſuch a ſtate, and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that we may be ſaved, and the Scripture not be broken, nay, in which if we ſhould not be ſaved, the Scripture would be broken.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, let us be exhorted to be much in bleſſing, and praiſing of God, yea, and in admiring, and adoring his infinite wiſdom, mercy, and goodneſs, that the Scripture, being that which cannot be broken, he ſhould contrive, and find out a way, ſo as for man to be ſaved, and yet his truth, the Scripture, what he had ſaid upon mans ſinning be ſalved, and not be broken; man had ſinned, and man muſt dye for ſin, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what God had ſaid,
<hi>Gen. 2. 19. for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:121189:75"/> ſhalt ſurely dye, i. e.</hi> not only ſpiritually, and temporally, but eternally; and now God out of his infinite wiſdom, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite goodneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives, and finds out ſuch a way by his Son becoming man, that as man had ſinned, ſo man he doth dye for ſin, his Son becoming man, and dying, yea, ſuffers what was equivalent to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, even to eternal death, and the pains of hell for ever, the whole wrath of God due to the ſin of man, being poured forth upon him; &amp; thoſe ſufferings, though only for a ſhort time, yet being the ſufferings of ſuch a one, of him who was God, as well as man, were more than if all the world had ſuffered for ever, and did countervail everlaſting death and damnation.</p>
               <p>And thus man is ſaved, and yet Gods truth ſalved, and his juſtice ſatisfied, the Scripture not broken; and this it was the Lords own doing, the contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his wiſdom, and the product of his goodneſs, and mercy; and it is that which ſhould be very marvellous for ever in our eyes, and provoke us to be much in bleſſing, and praiſing of his name. And the more to provoke, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:121189:76"/> ſtir us up hereunto, conſider but theſe few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That according to what God had ſaid, we were all upon ſinning, in a loſt and undone condition, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if God could not have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and withall have ſalved what he had ſaid, but that muſt have been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he would never have ſaved us, no, he would rather break a whole world, yea, were it ten thouſand worlds, than have his truth broken, he is
<hi>Iehovah,</hi> and cannot but give being to what he ſpeaks. Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but his words cannot paſs away. Again</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider that it was beyond the Wiſedom and contrivement of all the Creatures in Heaven and in Earth, to finde out ſuch a way as that Man might be ſaved, and yet withall, what God had ſaid be ſalved, the Scripture not be broken. We find in the 6th. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>Darius</hi> there ſignes a Writing and a Decree, <hi>That whoſoever ſhould ask a Petition of any God or man
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:121189:76"/> for 30. daies ſave of him, ſhould be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Den of Lions; &amp; Daniel</hi> yet, when he knew that the Writing was ſigned, prayed as he did aforetime, thrice a day; And now when the King hears of this, he is ſore diſpleaſed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>and ſets his heart on Daniel to deliver him, and he labeured, it is ſaid,</hi> Verſe 14. <hi>till the going down of the Sun to deliver him,</hi> but his Statute and Decree being that which might not be changed, he could not do it, but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> is caſt into the Den of Lions. No more could all the Creatures in Heaven or in Earth have found out a way for Man to have been ſaved, and Gods Word be verified, no, but he muſt for ever, had it been left to them, have been caſt into Hell, the redemption of their Souls, though never ſo pretious, muſt have ceaſt for ever; as concerning ſuch Wiſdom, we might ſay as <hi>Job 28. 12. Where ſhall it be found? and where is the place of it? man knoweth not the price of it, neither was it to be found in the Land of the living, the depth ſaith, it is not in me, and the Sea ſaith, it is not in me,</hi> &amp;c. And then conſider,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:121189:77"/>4. Fourthly, that God now after all this, ſhould find out a way ſo to ſave man, as that what he had ſaid ſhould not be diſſolved nor violated, O what thanks can we render unto God for this? that he ſhould do it, when all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth could never have done it, and yet when as if it had not been done, if ſuch a way had not been contrived, man muſt have been undone for ever, and that God ſhould now do it, O what thanks can we, I ſay, render to God for this? how admirable ſhould this be in our eyes? eſpecially if we conſider the way he contrived, and took to do it; that we might be ſaved, and the Scripture not be broken, he is pleaſed to break his Son, to bruiſe him, <hi>Iſay 53. 10. Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him; he hath put him to grief,</hi> &amp;c. That he might ſpare us, he did not ſpare him, no, not his own Son, his dear Son, his beloved Son, his onely begotten Son, but
<hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up,</hi> he comes down from Heaven, becomes Man, and being found in faſhion as a Man, humbles himſelf, and becomes obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:121189:77"/> and all, that we might live, and Gods truth not be violated; <hi>For God ſo loved the Word, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believes on him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>And in this was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted the Love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his onely begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him,</hi> thus <hi>by the grace of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Hebrewes
2. 9. Jeſus Chriſt he taſtes death for every man,</hi> i. e. for all ſorts of men, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Elect, for every one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, for every one who hath life and ſalvation, he taſtes Death, he dyes for them, in their place, and in their ſtead, <hi>Gal. 3. 13.
